# Financial Event Study in Python

This repo contains the code I wrote as part of the homeworks of the course in Computational Investing Part I on Coursera.

The main file is Homework4.py. Run this file only after installing the QSTK library. The installation will provide all the modules and functions called in the script together with the sp5002012 txt file at the base of the market simulation.

Enjoy!
